tutorial_1b
tutorial_1c
tutorial_1d
tutorial_1e
tutorial_2a
tutorial_2b
tutorial_2c
tutorial_3a
tutorial_3b
tutorial_3c
tutorial_3d
tutorial_4c
tutorial_4e

Boss Battles (these don't appear in quickplay and will most likely break if you use them):
bossslash
bosstom
bossdevil

Calibration Songs (these will likely break calibration and don't appear on the main setlist. you could try to use them and load them with the debug menu for an extra 3 songs for your song limit tho):
synctest
synctestplaytoaudio
synctestaudioandvisual
