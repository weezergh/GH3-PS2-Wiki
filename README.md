# Welcome!
Welcome to the Guitar Hero III PS2 Wiki! This wiki is dedicated to modding Guitar Hero III's PS2 port. We will cover topics such as installing custom songs, editing text, enabling the debug menu and more.

# The Basics
Before we get started, it's important that you understand a few terms we will use throughout almost all of the guides:

# What is a WAD file?
A WAD file is a file that contains all of the game's data (except for audio). It contains the game's QB file, charts, character models and so on. Every time the QB file is modified, this file must be recompiled.

# What is a QB file?
QB stands for Q Binary, which is a compiled form of Q Script, Neversoft's own scripting language. It contains almost all of the game's code, including Note Streak text, the menus, the chart metadata and so on. Pretty much all modifications we make will involve editing the QB file, which inevitably will involve editing the WAD file.

# What is Honeycomb-GUI?
Honeycomb-GUI is a toolkit that allows for the extraction and recompilation of WAD and QB files, as well as the compiling of songs and importing .sgh setlists for PC. Pretty much every single modification we make will need this program, since we need it to extract our game's WAD and QB files, and recompile once we're done modifying them.

# What is a checksum?
A checksum in Guitar Hero III is an internal ID that's used internally. For example, when you enter a song, let's use The Seeker for this example, the game won't ask for "The Seeker", instead it asks for the checksum "theseeker".

# What is the Debug Menu? I don't see it in my game!
The Debug Menu is a menu that was used internally by Neversoft and Budcat during Guitar Hero III's development, that would assist the developers in doing many things, like enabling bots, freecam, and what we're interested in: Playing Songs, since by using the Debug Menu, we can play every single checksum, including tutorial and calibration songs, which gives us an extra 16 songs for our song limit. However, this menu **is not visible by default**, since it was not meant for the consumers, but for the developers. Luckily, we can re-enable this menu with a simple QB mod, and we even have a guide teaching you how to do it!
